## Principles of adaptive design


## Ubiquity

- This is not the web (graphic)
- This is the web (graohic)
- The power of the web is ubiquity
- Diversity is not a bug, it's opportunity
- Stop thinking of mobile as "web light"
- Mobile users want do what desktop users do
- Give people what they want regardless of how they are accesing it


#### Content parity

- Content parity trumps all


#### flexibility 

- ish - by brad frost is a rdw tool


## Performance

- Users expect mobile sites to load as fast or faster than desktop counteparts
- You have 5 seconds for page load
- Mobile screens should not be served the same assets as desktop sites
- Performance is an accessibility issue


#### Performance is invisible

- You can't mock up performance in a photoshop file
- Performance is usually brought up in really geeky terms
- Elevate performance as a design feature
- Good performance IS good design
- Mobitest - nice performance tool


## Enhancement

- progressive enhancement
- Start with core experience then test browser capabilities
- Use modernizr


#### A word on "mobile apps"

- support is not binary
- javascript will fail
- Client side architecture is slow
- There is a difference between support and optimization
- Meet people where they are


## Future Friendly

- Acknowledge the unpredictibility of the web
- We can't be future proof, but future friendly


## Invest in your content

- Make API's not war
- Your API IS your application
- Think of content like water
- Get your content ready to go anywhere because it's going to go everywhere
- the more backward-compatible you are the more future-compatible you will be

## Navigation

- There when you need it but cool enough to give you your space
- Prioritize search
	
	
## Carosels

- Make sure you actually need one - everyone wants their stuff on the homepage, soâ€¦
- Cycle through like items
- Only load what you need
- Be explicit with your navigation
- Give hints to related content


### Code snippets

<pre><code class="language-css">&lt;input type="search" /&gt;
&lt;input type="number" pattern="[0-9]" /&gt;</code></pre>


### Social buttons

Social Count - by filament group


### Auxilary content

- Aggressive enhancement
- Figure out what the "core" content is and load in the content that is secondary


### Scannability

- Scrolling 
- Going back in time
- Scroll through groups
- Diving in deep into content
 

### Performance
