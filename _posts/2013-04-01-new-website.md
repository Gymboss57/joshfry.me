exerpt: Introducing my new website, using Jekyllâ€“a static site generator.

---

I decided to use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) for my new website. Jekyll is a static site generator which means there's no database to manage, I can write all of my posts in Markdown and use git for version control and to push updates to my server. I really didn't want to use Wordpress for my new site because compared to Jekyll, Wordpress just feels like a brick.

If using a static site generator sounds interesting to you but you're not sure where to begin, [this tutorial](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/other/building-static-sites-with-jekyll/) got *me* up and running and the [Jekyll Wiki](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki) has everything else.
