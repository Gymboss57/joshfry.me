<p class="intro">We need to build our front-end out of simple parts, connected by well defined interfaces so that problems are local and parts of the program can be replaced in the future.</p>


## Modules

- The new way of developing websites
- Module 1 - image with text - has some html css js
- module 2 - search form


## Build process

- How then do we organize these modules?


## SMACSS

- Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS
- [http://smacss.com](http://smacss.com)


## How SMACSS is organized

1. base = reset and type defaults
2. layout = grid and structure
3. module = (.module)
4. state = :hover
5. theme
6. Self Realization


<pre><code class="language-css">.module {
  background: pink;
}
module:hover {
  opacity: .8;
}
.module--blue {
  background: blue;		
}</code></pre>

## Final Comments
- In RWD we're creating systems
- Interactive styleguides, prototypes, etc
- Demo, or it isn't billable
- Tiny bootstraps for every client
