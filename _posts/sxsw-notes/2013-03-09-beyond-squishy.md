<!--# Beyond Squishy: The Principles of Adaptive Design-->
  
<p class="intro">Responsive layouts are just the tip of the iceburg</p>

## Principles of adaptive design

### ubiquity

- this is not the web (graphic)
- this is the web (graohic)
- the power of the web is ubiquity
- diversity is not a bug, it's opportunity
- stop thinking of mobile as "web light"
- mobile users want do what desktop users do
- Give people what they want regardless of how they are accesing it

### Content parity

- Content parity trumps all

### flexibility 

- ish - by brad frost is a rdw tool

### Performance

- users expect mobile sites to load as fast or faster than desktop counteparts
- You have 5 seconds for page load
- Mobile screens should not be served the same assets as desktop sites
- **Performance is an accessibility issue**

### Performance is invisible

- you can't mock up performance in a photoshop file
- performance is usually brought up in really geeky terms
- **Evevate performance as a design feature**
- good performance IS good design
- Mobitest - nice performance tool

## Enhancement

- progressive enhancement
- Start with core experience then test browser capabilities
- Use modernizr

### A word on "mobile apps"
- support is not binary
- javascript will fail
- Client side architecture is slow
- There is a difference between support and optimization
- Meet people where they are


## Future Friendly

- Acknowledge the unpredictibility of the web
- We can't be future proof, but future friendly

### Focus

- see futurefriendly manifesto
- if your provide crap, there's other ways to get to your content 

### Invest in your content

- Make API's not war
- Your API IS your application
- Think of content like water
- Get your content ready to go anywhere because it's going to go everywhere
- the more backward-compatible you are the more future-compatible you will be

### Say what?
**You can create larger images that have smaller file sizes than smaller images**

### Navigation

- There when you need it but cool enough to give you your space
- prioritize search
	
### Carosels

- make sure you actually need one
	- people all want their stuff on the homepage, soâ€¦
- cycle through like items
- only load what you need
- be explicit with your navigation
- give hints to related content

#### Code snippets

<pre><code class='language-html'>&lt;input type="search" /&gt;
&lt;input type="number" pattern="[0-9]" /&gt;</code></pre>
	
#### Social buttons

social count - by filament group

####  Ask questions

#### Auxilary content

- aggressive enhancement
- figure out what the "core" content is and load in the content that is secondary

#### Scannability

- scrolling 
  - going back in time
  - scroll through groups
  - diving in deep into content
 
 always scrolling thorough a singular content type

#### Performance
