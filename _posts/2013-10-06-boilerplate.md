So I've been working on this big project at work: A pattern library/styleguide for our upcoming CMS migration/redesign. I needed a way to develop, document and display the site components I was building for our team and came across this thing called [Assemble](http://assemble.io) when I saw it being used on [Effect.css](http://h5bp.github.io/Effeckt.css/dist/). Assemble has become an integral part of my workflowâ€“It's a super-fast static site generator built for [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com).

I've been using Grunt for a little while now and have come up with a pretty nifty Gruntfile. It uses Assemble as well as a few other modern dev tools, like Sass, Bourbon, Bourbon Neat. I took what I made for the styleguide at work and made a bare-bones boilerplate for anyone to use. Here's a link to the repo:
