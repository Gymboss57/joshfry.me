exerpt: My new website runs on Jekyll. Yay for static site generators!

---

I redesigned my website recently and decided to build it with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator. What I love about Jekyll is that there's no database to manage, I can write my posts in Markdown and when I `$ git push` to Github, my website is automatically updated.

At some point I would like to document my workflow and how I set up Jekyll. One thing I want to point out is [guard-jekyll-plus](https://github.com/imathis/guard-jekyll-plus) by Brandon Mathisâ€“it's a must-have plugin if you're compiling Sass.
