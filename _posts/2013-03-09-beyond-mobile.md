## Sensors give us superpowers  

- Touch
- GPS
- Gyroscope


### shopper.app

- Based on gps it rearranges your shopping list for the store your at so that you can get to all the different departments more seemlessly


### Augmented Reality

- word lense.app - translates words on the screen
- Table Drum


## How do we design for sensors, not the screen

### Sensors

- Anytouch - [http://bitly.com/anytouch](http://bitly.com/anytouch) -Turn anything into a touch interface
- Leapmotion
- The best touch interface is sometimes no touch at all
  gesture + speech = magic
- Disney - botanicus - turn a plant into a touch interface

### Mirroring

- Airplay
- bit.ly/samsung-smart

### Remote Control

- Beyond mirroring
- using your iOS device to control a video game on a tv
- Microsoft Smart Glass


## Migrating Interfaces

- When the interface follows you
- A phone call in the car.. you start talking to the car.. then you walk away. **The interface follows you**
- Toy makers and video game makers are way ahead in the concept of teaching new interfaces

**It takes 20 years for tech to be real from time of concept** - Bill Buxton [@wasbuxton](https://twitter.com/wasbuxton)

## Sifteo Cubes  

- hardware aware little cubes


## Just in time, not just in case

- Nest Thermostat
- Meet Lumo - hardware device the helps with posture
- Hapifork - monitor eating behavior


## We mostly want dumb devices for our smart devices to interact with

- Presentation depricates
- **Your API is the application**  
- An app is not a strategy
