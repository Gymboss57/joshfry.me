## How it started

I've been working on this big project at work: A pattern library/styleguide for our upcoming CMS migration/redesign. I needed a way to develop, document and display the site components I was building for our team and came across this thing called [Assemble](http://assemble.io) being used on [Effect.css](http://h5bp.github.io/Effeckt.css/dist/).

## Assemble

After learning the ins-and-outs of Assemble, it has become the most valuable tool in my front-end tool belt. It's a super-fast static site generator built for [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com). I use it for so many things. It's powering my personal website and blog, for one. But my favorite usage for it is as a rapid prototype machine!

When developing reusable components for a big website, I'm able to experiment quickly and write less code by using json data and handlebar templates! At the same time, I generate a living styleguide for the team and keep the documentation up-to-date.

## Grunt

I've been using Grunt for a little while now and have come up with a pretty nifty Gruntfile. It uses Assemble as well as a few other modern dev tools, like Sass, Bourbon, Bourbon Neat.

> I took what I made for the styleguide at work and made a bare-bones boilerplate for anyone to use.
